# Simon-Says-Game
A browser-based memory sequence game built with vanilla web technologies. This project demonstrates state management, asynchronous UI updates, and local data persistence.

Core Functionality

Sequence Logic: The application generates a random pattern that increases in length each round.

Input Validation: Compares user interactions against the stored sequence in real-time.

State Management: Tracks current score, levels, and active game states.

Data Persistence: Uses localStorage to save and display the user's high score across sessions.


Technical Stack

HTML5: Document structure and UI containers.

CSS3: Layout, responsive design, and animation effects.

JavaScript: Game logic, event handling, and timing control.


Instructions

Start: Click the "PLAY" button.

Observe: Watch the sequence of color flashes.

Input: Click the colors in the exact order shown.

Progression: The pattern grows by one color after every successful round.

Game Over: The game ends if a color is clicked out of sequence.
